A crowd-source metadata tool for Swarthmore College's contentDM instance.

The idea is, eventually, a web-app to:

1) display contentDM content hosted locally through the API
2) an interface for said web-app
3) a store for user-added tags
4) a workflow for adding new metadata back to contentDM after verification
